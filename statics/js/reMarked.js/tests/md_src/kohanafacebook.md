## Follow these steps:

1. Copy the entire directory structure to your web document root.
   e.g. application directory should be in `/`, relative to the document root

2. Create a Facebook application at [http://www.facebook.com/developers/](http://www.facebook.com/developers/)

3. Import the included `kohanafacebook.sql` file into a MySQL database,
   using PHPMyAdmin's import feature, the import feature of your preferred
   MySQL IDE, or the mysql command line tool.

4. Edit `/config.inc.php` and fill in the appropriate values, from your
   Facebook application's settings page and from your MySQL Database
   into which you just imported the test settings.

5. Edit `.htaccess` to reflect the correct RewriteBase. This should match the
   baseurl in `/config.inc.php`. If you host it at `http://site.com/`, the `baseurl`
   and `RewriteBase` should be `/`. If you host it at `http://site.com/kohana/`,
   the baseurl and RewriteBase should be /kohana/.

6. Get your Facebook numeric ID. If you go to your Facebook page and it
   looks like `http://facebook.com/FriendlyUserName`, go to
   `http://graph.facebook.com/FriendlyUserName` - This will give you your numeric
   ID. If your page looks like `http://facebook.com/1234567890`, `1234567890` is
   your numeric Facebook ID.

7. Add your Facebook numeric ID into the admins table in the MySQL database
   so that you can be an admin on the site. Feel free to remove the others
   in there (mine).

8. *(Optional)* Delete the `kohanafacebook.sql` file in your web root so that
   potential attackers cannot access it via the website.
