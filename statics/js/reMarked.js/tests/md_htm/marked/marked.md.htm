<h1>marked</h1>
<p>A full-featured markdown parser and compiler.
Built for speed.</p>
<h2>Benchmarks</h2>
<p>node v0.4.x</p>

<p>node v0.6.x</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ node test --bench
marked completed in 6448ms.
marked (gfm) completed in 7357ms.

<p><strong>Marked is now faster than Discount, which is written in C.</strong></p>
<p>For those feeling skeptical: These benchmarks run the entire markdown test suite
1000 times. The test suite tests every feature. It doesn&#39;t cater to specific
aspects.</p>
<p>Benchmarks for other engines to come (?).</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ npm install marked</code></pre>
<h2>Another javascript markdown parser</h2>
<p>The point of marked was to create a markdown compiler where it was possible to
frequently parse huge chunks of markdown without having to worry about
caching the compiled output somehow...or blocking for an unnecesarily long time.</p>
<p>marked is very concise and still implements all markdown features. It is also
now fully compatible with the client-side.</p>
<p>marked more or less passes the official markdown test suite in its
entirety. This is important because a surprising number of markdown compilers
cannot pass more than a few tests. It was very difficult to get marked as
compliant as it is. It could have cut corners in several areas for the sake
of performance, but did not in order to be exactly what you expect in terms
of a markdown rendering. In fact, this is why marked could be considered at a
disadvantage in the benchmarks above.</p>
<p>Along with implementing every markdown feature, marked also implements
<a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/">GFM features</a>.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<p>marked has 3 different switches which change behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>pedantic</strong>: Conform to obscure parts of <code>markdown.pl</code> as much as possible.
Don&#39;t fix any of the original markdown bugs or poor behavior.</li>
<li><strong>gfm</strong>: Enabled github flavored markdown (default for backward compatibility).</li>
<li><strong>sanitize</strong>: Sanitize the output. Ignore any HTML that has been input.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the above are mutually exclusive/inclusive.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-js">// set default options
marked.setOptions({
  gfm: true,
  pedantic: false,
  sanitize: true
});
console.log(marked(&#39;i am using __markdown__.&#39;));</code></pre>
<p>You also have direct access to the lexer and parser if you so desire.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var tokens = marked.lexer(str);
console.log(marked.parser(tokens));</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ node
&gt; require(&#39;marked&#39;).lexer(&#39;&gt; i am using marked.&#39;)
[ { type: &#39;blockquote_start&#39; },
  { type: &#39;text&#39;, text: &#39; i am using marked.&#39; },
  { type: &#39;blockquote_end&#39; },
  links: {} ]</code></pre>
<h2>CLI</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ marked -o hello.html
hello world
^D
$ cat hello.html
&lt;p&gt;hello world&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<h2>Syntax Highlighting</h2>
<p>Marked has an interface that allows for a syntax highlighter to highlight code
blocks before they&#39;re output.</p>
<p>Example implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var highlight = require(&#39;my-syntax-highlighter&#39;)
  , marked_ = require(&#39;marked&#39;);

var marked = function(text) {
  var tokens = marked_.lexer(text)
    , l = tokens.length
    , i = 0
    , token;

  for (; i &lt; l; i++) {
    token = tokens[i];
    if (token.type === &#39;code&#39;) {
      token.text = highlight(token.text, token.lang);
      // marked should not escape this
      token.escaped = true;
    }
  }

  text = marked_.parser(tokens);

  return text;
};

module.exports = marked;</code></pre>
